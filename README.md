# ✨ Why Web Jotter Exists

Web Jotter was born from a simple frustration:

> _“Why does my browser look like a crime scene every night?”_

Tabs everywhere.  
Quotes you meant to save.  
Sessions you meant to revisit.  
And zero motivation to clean any of it.

**Web Jotter exists to bring calm to the chaos**, blending:
- Fun comic-book aesthetics  
- Intuitive UI  
- Practical tools for everyday browsing  

It’s the browser companion we wished existed — one that doesn’t just save your tabs, but gives them style.

# 🎨 Theme & Design Philosophy

Web Jotter follows a simple creative rule:

> _“If a comic hero would use it, it belongs in the UI.”_

That means:
- **Bangers** for headings  
- **Mulish** for smooth body text  
- Neon accents  
- Soft shadows  
- Vibrant bubbles and mascot rings  
- Playful motion  

Yet everything is still:
- Accessible  
- Clean  
- Legible  
- Professional  

This balance is what makes the extension feel **alive but usable**.
